## Project: Finding Donors for CharityML

## Project Overview
In this project, we will apply supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause. We will first explore the data to learn how the census data is recorded. Next, we will apply a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format. We will then evaluate several supervised learners of your choice on the data, and consider which is best suited for the solution. Afterwards, we will optimize the model we've selected and present it as our solution to CharityML. Finally, we will explore the chosen model and its predictions under the hood, to see just how well it's performing when considering the data it's given.

## Project Highlights
This project is designed to get us acquainted with the many supervised learning algorithms available in sklearn, and to also provide for a method of evaluating just how each model works and performs on a certain type of data. It is important in machine learning to understand exactly when and where a certain algorithm should be used, and when one should be avoided.

Things we will learn by completing this project:

How to identify when preprocessing is needed, and how to apply it.
How to establish a benchmark for a solution to the problem.
What each of several supervised learning algorithms accomplishes given a specific dataset.
How to investigate whether a candidate solution model is adequate for the problem.

### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

### Run

This project contains three files:

- `finding_donors.ipynb`: This is the main file where you will be performing your work on the project.
- `census.csv`: The project dataset. You'll load this data in the notebook.
- `visuals.py`: A Python file containing visualization code that is run behind-the-scenes. Do not modify

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory finding_donors/ (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook finding_donors.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook finding_donors.ipynb
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.

Alternatively, you can use the command `jupyter notebook` or `ipython notebook` and navigate to the notebook file in the browser window that opens. 

### Data

The modified census dataset consists of approximately 32,000 data points, with each datapoint having 13 features. This dataset is a modified version of the dataset published in the paper *"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: a Decision-Tree Hybrid",* by Ron Kohavi. You may find this paper [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf), with the original dataset hosted on [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income).
